/*Using Product table, find out the number of makers who produce only one model.*/
My solution: Result is the same but too many code 
with mak as
(select count(maker) qty
from product
where maker = 'A'
union
select count(maker) qty
from product
where maker = 'B'
union 
select count(maker) qty
from product
where maker = 'C'
union
select count(maker) qty
from product
where maker = 'D'
union
select count(maker) qty
from product
where maker = 'E')

select  qty
from mak
where qty = (select min(qty) from mak)

Better one:
select count(maker)
from (select maker 
      from product
      group by maker  
      having count(model)=1) a
